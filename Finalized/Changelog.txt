Version 0.0.1 - Initial Version - Committed by: Sean Moss - 3/14/13
	+ Basic TileEngine class, made by calling a constructor, then the Initialize method. Still lacks a way to 
		draw and update the engine and tiles.
	+ Simple tile class, can be extended to create a custom tile, or a new instance of Tile can be initialized. 
		Tiles are automatically added to the list of added tiles in the engine.
	+ Texture Loading, works by loading a texture from the texture path and file name (defaults to tilename.xnb).
		The location of the file is controlled by overrideable functions.
	+ Tile Directory, that keeps tile ids and names from being repeated.
	+ Simple implementation of Tiles that represent liquids.
