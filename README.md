RMTileEngine
============

A simple 2D tile engine based on the XNA/MONOGAME .NET framework. This is currently very early in production, the
initial commit was only made in mid-March. It is based on a Windows Phone 8 class library, but it should work with any
other platform supported by Monogame. Made with Monogame 3.0, which you will need in order to develop for this.

This was originally going to be a nice simple library for a school project, but I thought it could go further than that,
so I pushed it to GitHub.

If you want to help, just submit a detailed Pull Request, for contact me to become a collaborator.
